This is an excellent practical example for learning MCP! It perfectly simulates a real-world financial services scenario and will give you hands-on experience with multiple interconnected MCP tools. Your proposed example absolutely makes sense and will create a working solution that can answer all those client advisor questions.
Why This Example is Great for Learning MCP

Real-world relevance: Simulates actual wealth management workflows
Tool interdependency: Tools build on each other (clients → positions → recommendations)
Complex queries: Enables sophisticated analysis across multiple data dimensions
Practical testing: Easy to validate with realistic scenarios

Phased Development Approach
Phase 1: Foundation + Tool 1 (Client List)

Set up MCP server structure
Implement client list tool with sample data
Test basic client queries

Phase 2: Tool 2 (Client Positions)

Add position data structure
Implement position retrieval by client
Test position-based queries

Phase 3: Tool 3 (Recommendations)

Add recommendation system
Implement ISIN-based recommendations
Test recommendation queries

Phase 4: Integration & Advanced Queries

Optimize cross-tool functionality
Test complex multi-dimensional queries
Add error handling and validation

Data Structure Preview
Your example will support queries like:

"Which clients have SELL rated positions?" → Cross-reference Tools 2 & 3
"Which clients hold >50% cash?" → Analyze Tool 2 data
"Which clients hold Apple?" → Search Tool 2 positions
"Which clients have no stocks?" → Filter Tool 2 by position types

Next Steps
Let's start with Phase 1. I'll help you build the MCP server foundation and implement Tool 1 (client list). This will give you:

Proper MCP server structure
Sample client data (BZ-xxxxxxx format)
Basic tool registration and handling
Testing framework
