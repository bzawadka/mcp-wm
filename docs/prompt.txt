act as my collogue, pair programmer and brainstorming partner. I would like to learn MCP (model context protocol) in practice. I have simple local MCP server with two tools (alerts and weather forecast). Local server (written in python) is connected to local Claude desktop.

I would like to write more practical example. 

Help me to create one (generate code), which is more practical.

Comment first if it makes sense, and prepare phased approach, where I can add one part of the system in a phase, test/run it separately, and then add next part.

Scope of the demo/program. Have a few MCP tools. Simulate Claude desktop being an interface for client advisor in wealth management bank. 
Tool 1: return a list of my clients. Each client has an identifier in a format "BZ-xxxxxxx", where 'x' are digits. Current user of Claude desktop is a client advisor.

Tool 2: return a list of positions (equities, bonds, cash) for selected client. For example a client "BZ-00001" has positions: Apple stock, TLT bond, and cash position. Each equity position has number of shares and valuation in USD, each bond position has nominal in USD and current price in %, and current valuation in USD, each cash position has amount in USD. Each bond and equity position is identified by ISIN. Tool should generate sample response for 10 clients, each holding 3 to 10 positions.

Tool 3: return a list of recommendations for a position (BUY, SELL, NEUTRAL). Tool 3is a service which should return recommendations for each ISIN (as generated by Tool 2).

Does this example make sense? Will it create a working solution, where client advisor (myself using Claude Desktop) can ask Claude questions such as:
* which of my clients has SELL rated positions?
* which of my clients holds more than 50% of cash?
* which of my clients holds Apple equity?
* which of my clients does not have any stocks?
* which of my clients holds bonds?

Let's have a conversation if this example is possible to build, and - if yes - help me to write one in Pyhon, step by step.
